**KP HACKDAY** | An Google appscript to run the Ringdown.

***

During the Hackathon we were able to get the Ohana Web-Search to pull data from the Baltimore Ohana Api however
a major concern the we have is the ability to talk with community members. So we outlined three main design considerations:

  - The "front-end" of the tool should be user friendly (Someone with no database experience should be able to use it)
  - It should be free if possible
  - It should work out of the box

***


So we have decided to start the project using Google Sheets as our "database" and Forms for the sign-up process.

We were only able to get halfway, but so far we can run a sheet bound script to call through a list of volunteers using the twillio number that we provisioned for the sms client.



TODO:

- Sign-up Sheet for volunteers
- Training videos For volunteers
- Dedicated inbound call number to activate the ringdown
- Complete execution script
	- Accept inbound Post from twillio


Thank you everyone for your support throughout the Hackathon. We look forward to serving Baltimore!
